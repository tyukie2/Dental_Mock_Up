        <p id="one" style="float:left;">Was able to get my mom quickly for an emergency procedure during quarantine. Dr. Yelena is very intelligent and insightful, she considers problems thoroughly to come up with the proper care. Dr. Yelena also offers alternative solutions and naturopathic methods when appropriate.
